# Real-Time Drosophila Tracking and Analysis System

## Overview

Designed for real-time video analysis, this deep learning-based system segments and tracks Drosophila in a Y-maze, calculating the time spent in each arm with high accuracy. The system automates behavioral pattern analysis and is validated for consistent performance and spatial accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-time Tracking**: Tracks Drosophila movement in the Y-maze in real time.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Calculates and records the time spent by Drosophila in each maze arm.
- **Automated Behavioral Analysis**: Automates the analysis of Drosophila behavioral patterns.
- **High Accuracy**: Ensures high spatial accuracy and consistent system performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **PyTorch**
- **OpenCV**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**
- **Matplotlib**

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components, each responsible for different aspects of the tracking system:

- **data_processing.py**: Handles data ingestion and preprocessing.
- **model_training.py**: Manages the CNN model training for tracking.
- **video_analysis.py**: Implements real-time video tracking and analysis.
- **results_visualization.py**: Generates visual outputs of the tracking results using Matplotlib.
- **main.py**: Integrates all components and executes the system.

## Setup and Installation

 **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-drosophila-tracking.git
   cd real-time-drosophila-tracking
